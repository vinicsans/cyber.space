# cyber.space - Winner of the Swift Student Challenge üöÄ

**cyber.space** is an educational and interactive game developed to raise awareness about the importance of **cybersecurity**. In it, players take on the role of Michael, an intergalactic traveler who must protect his ship from digital threats while traveling to the planet Aqualis. During this journey, players face challenges based on real attacks, such as **nanorobot invasions** and **phishing attempts**, while learning good security practices like using **strong passwords** and **identifying fraudulent emails**.

> **Award**: cyber.space was one of the winners of the **Swift Student Challenge**, an international competition hosted by **Apple**. üéâ

## Objectives

- **Educational Gameplay**: Teaches cybersecurity concepts through interactive challenges.

- **Real-World Attack Scenarios**: Face nanorobot invasions, phishing attempts, and more.

- **Digital Awareness**: Learn how to create strong passwords and spot online fraud.

- **Exclusive Aesthetics**: All graphic elements were hand-crafted to provide a unique experience.

## üåå The Creative Process

The development of **cyber.space** was inspired by the connection between the online world and the vast unpredictability of space. The game creation process involved:

1. Choosing the space theme to represent digital challenges (*a theme I really enjoy*).
2. Manually creating all the graphic elements.
3. Detailed planning to ensure an immersive and educational experience.

## üöÄ Development Challenges

- A significant challenge was finding ways to teach players how to identify phishing attacks, requiring in-depth research and constant testing to ensure it didn‚Äôt become boring.

- The project was developed using a MacMini remotely accessed from the Federal Institute of Cear√°, which caused delays when the equipment became unavailable.
